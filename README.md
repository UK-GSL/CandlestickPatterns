# Candlestick Pattern Detection Based on OHLC Data

This module scans OHLC data and tests for CandleStick Patterns based on shape data. 

This is largely an educational project, so feel free to offer advice, criticism or contributions

The formulas i use to detect are based on the OHLC criteria and my main source is : https://www.candlescanner.com/patterns-dictionary/

# Current Pattern List:
 - Doji
 - Bearish Engulfing
 - Dark Cloud Cover
 - Three Outside Down
 - Evening Star Doji
 - Bearish Harami

# To-Do 
- Add more candle stick patterns
- Make more user friendly
- Improve algorithms
- Add some customization/sensitivity options
- Add a trend indicator to improve detection
- (maybe) plotting
- (maybe) testing
- (maybe) add functions to detect candle color, shape, trend etc.

To use this module, you'll need to import the module into your project and configure the Sheet/Range variables to fit your dataset.

Additionally, i have included an example .xlsm with AAPL daily data, with the module configured.
